Manhattan Population Explorer is a web mapping tool that allows users to explore the dynamic population of Manhattan. Here are the key details about its technology and unique features:


## Purpose:
The tool aims to showcase the hourly distribution of Manhattan’s population.
It’s valuable for urban planners, public safety managers, and geography enthusiasts.

## Visualization Technology:
MapBox GL JS: Used for rendering the interactive map.
D3.js: Employed for creating charts and graphs.


Since most Manhattanites use the MTA’s subway system, subway entrance and exit data serve as a good proxy for population distribution. The tool visualizes population flows hour-by-hour, revealing patterns across neighborhoods. Users can explore both obvious and subtle population movement patterns. The visualization represents a model of population flows for a hypothetical week in late spring.
