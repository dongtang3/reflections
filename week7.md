The ESA Star Mapper is a captivating visualization tool developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) in collaboration with TULP Interactive. It draws upon data from the ESA Hipparcos mission, an astrometric satellite that meticulously measured the positions, motions, and brightness of over a hundred thousand stars.





Stars are visualized based on their brightness (apparent magnitude). Additionally, users can explore their colors, providing a vivid representation of the stellar diversity. The tool allows users to view the names of the brightest stars and their parent constellations. This feature enhances our connection to the celestial objects we observe. Users can explore where stars were located in the past or will be in the future based on their measured motions. Itâ€™s a fascinating way to visualize stellar dynamics over time. The tool provides a sense of scale by showing the distance from the Sun for each star. Remarkably, some stars are thousands of light-years away!
